# Udacity Data Engineering Nanodegree Project 2: Data Modeling with Apache Cassandra

## Datasets
For this project, I worked with one dataset: event_data. The directory of CSV files partitioned by date. Here are examples of filepaths to two files in the dataset:
event_data/2018-11-08-events.csv
event_data/2018-11-09-events.csv

## Jupyter Notebook
which includes:
1. Processing the event_datafile_new.csv dataset to create a denormalized dataset
2. Modeling the data tables keeping in mind the queries you need to run
3. Loading the data into tables you create in Apache Cassandra and run your queries

## Project Steps
1. Modeling your NoSQL database or Apache Cassandra database
2. Designing tables to answer the queries outlined in the project template
3. Writing Apache Cassandra CREATE KEYSPACE and SET KEYSPACE statements
4. Developing CREATE statement for each of the tables to address each question
5. Loading the data with INSERT statement for each of the tables
6. Testing by running the proper select statements with the correct WHERE clause
